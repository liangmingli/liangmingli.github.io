== Did you get your annual eye exam this year? ...

I was diagnosed with a horseshoe retinal tear in the left eye during a regular eye exam back in 2014. I was shocked because I did not have any noticeable symptoms, but it left untreated could lead to severe vision loss.

After proper treatment, my left eye vision is satisfactorily preserved. I want to encourage everyone who's reading this text right now, go schedule your annual eye exam if you haven't! It's free if you have insurance, and it can be immensely valuable for protecting your eyes.
