== About me
I am a cognitive neuroscientist by training and currently working with brain (macro+micro) recordings obtained from neurosurgical patients. \n\n

I love exploring complex datasets through elegant and beautiful figures.  See [./visualizations.html visualization] for demo. \n\n

I received my PhD in psychology from University of Arizona, studying how we form memories of space and time. \n
